Explain the concept of Polymorphism to a five year old kid.

 Polymorphism in object oriented programming is a feature that take more than one shape, and it allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
 
 Polymorphism gives a way to use a class totally like its parent so there is no confusion of mixing types.
 
 
 
 #Bubble Sort
 
 (5 1 4 3 2 8) ----> (1 5 4 3 2 8), here algorithm compares the first two elements and swap since 5>1

(1 5 4 3 2 8) ----> (1 4 5 3 2 8) swap since 5>4.

(1 4 5 3 2 8) ----> (1 4 3 5 2 8) swap since 5>3

(1 4 3 5 2 8) ----> (1 4 3 2 5 8) swap since 5>2

(1 4 3 2 5 8) ----> (1 3 4 2 5 8) swap since 4>3

(1 3 4 2 5 8) ----> (1 3 2 4 5 8) swap since 4>2

(1 3 2 4 5 8)  ----> (1 2 3 4 5 8) swap since 3>2

(1 2 3 4 5 8).
